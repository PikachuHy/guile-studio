Racket has Dr Racket.  Guile has ... Emacs?  This is Emacs with a few
settings that make working with Guile easier for people new to Emacs.
Features include: CUA mode, Geiser, tool bar icons to evaluate Guile
buffers, support for Guile's very own picture language, code
completion, a simple mode line, etc.

Imagine a person who would love to learn Guile but is told to first
learn Emacs.  “Guile Studio” aims to be a more suitable programming
environment for Guile learners and Emacs agnostics.  The goal is not
to create yet another “prelude” or starter pack for general use of
Emacs.  Instead the only goal is to hide Emacs quirks and provide a
pleasant Guile + Geiser experience out of the box.

To build Guile Studio from source with Guix and run it try this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://git.elephly.net/software/guile-studio.git
cd guile-studio
make dist && $(guix build -L guix guile-studio-devel)/bin/guile-studio
#+END_SRC
